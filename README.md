## About The Project.

The Chatbot Project is an exciting endeavor aimed at creating a conversational agent capable of providing assistance, answering questions, and engaging in meaningful conversations. This chatbot is designed to serve a variety of purposes, from customer support to entertainment and beyond.

## Key Objectives.

- User Engagement: Create a chatbot that engages users in natural and meaningful conversations.
- Knowledge Base: Equip the chatbot with a vast knowledge base to answer questions on a wide range of topics.
Customization: Allow users to customize the chatbot's behavior and responses.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
